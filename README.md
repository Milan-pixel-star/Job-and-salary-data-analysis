# Job-and-salary-data-analysis

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze job market trends and salary distributions across various roles, experience levels, and locations using a dataset that includes information such as job titles, salaries, employment types, and company details. The analysis is visualized through an interactive dashboard that provides insights into global salary trends, remote work ratios, and company characteristics.

The dataset includes the following columns:

work_year: The year in which the salary data was recorded.
experience_level: The level of experience required for the job (e.g., Junior, Mid, Senior, Executive).
employment_type: Type of employment such as full-time, part-time, contract, or freelance.
job_title: The specific title of the job role (e.g., Data Scientist, Software Engineer).
salary: The salary offered for the job in its local currency.
salary_currency: The currency in which the salary is paid (e.g., USD, EUR).
salary_in_usd: The salary converted to USD for comparison purposes.
employee_residence: The location of the employee.
remote_ratio: The percentage of time the job is remote (0%, 50%, 100%).
company_location: The location of the company offering the job.
company_size: The size of the company, typically categorized as small, medium, or large.
Project Objectives
Salary Analysis: Examine salary trends across different job titles, experience levels, and locations, both in local currencies and USD.
Remote Work Trends: Analyze the ratio of remote work opportunities across various roles and experience levels.
Employment Types: Visualize the distribution of employment types (e.g., full-time, contract) across different roles and company sizes.
Global Job Trends: Identify job location trends by mapping where employees are located versus where the companies are based.
Tools & Technologies
Power BI: Used to create an interactive dashboard for exploring job market data, salary trends, and employment patterns.
Python: Utilized for initial data cleaning and pre-processing, such as currency conversion and outlier handling.
Key Features of the Dashboard
Salary Distribution: Visualizes salary trends across different roles, experience levels, and regions, with the ability to switch between local currency and USD.
Remote Work Insights: Displays how remote-friendly different job roles are and how this correlates with salary and experience levels.
Employment Types: Shows the breakdown of employment types (full-time, contract, etc.) by job title and company size.
Global Job Locations: Maps out employee and company locations to show trends in remote work and job distribution worldwide.
